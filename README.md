# python-to-do-list-project

Excited to share my latest Python projectâ€”a fully-functional To-Do List! from the #CodSoft internship under the guidance of Mr. Divakar Kushwaha Sir from Ducat Noida!

Project Overview:
I recently developed a Python-based to-do list application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. This project not only helped me enhance my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of Python's functionalities and GUI libraries.

Technologies Used:
Python: For core logic implementation.

Tkinter: For creating the user-friendly graphical interface.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): To structure the project efficiently.

Key Features:
Task Addition and Deletion: Easily add and delete tasks.

Task Completion Tracking: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.

Error Handling: Effective management of common input errors.

Extendable: Designed to easily incorporate additional features like deadlines, reminders, and categories.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸ˜Š #Python #Programming #Project #ToDoList #CodeNewbie #Tech #LinkedIn
